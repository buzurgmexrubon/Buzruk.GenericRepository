## Embrace the Future of Data Access (v1.0.0 - Initial Release)

This changelog chronicles the groundbreaking advancements in Buzruk.GenericRepository, the game-changing generic repository for .NET applications. Buckle up, developers, because v1.0.0 is here to revolutionize your data access experience!

## Introducing an Asynchronous Powerhouse:

- **Asynchronous-First Philosophy**: Ditch the wait! Core functionalities prioritize asynchronous methods for blazing-fast, non-blocking data retrieval and manipulation. Synchronous options remain available for compatibility. ⚡️
- **Effortless Bulk Operations (Async)**: Supercharge performance with asynchronous AddRangeAsync and UpdateRangeAsync methods, allowing you to add or update multiple entities with unparalleled efficiency.

## Streamlined Data Management:

- **Intuitive CRUD Operations**: A comprehensive suite of methods like GetAsync, GetPagedAsync, AddAsync, AddRangeAsync, UpdateAsync, and more simplifies CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a smoother workflow.
- **Flexible Retrieval**: Uncover specific entities by ID or filter them based on your criteria using the versatile GetAsync. Pinpoint the exact data you need, when you need it.
- **Paged Data Fetching (Async)**: Conquer large datasets with GetPagedAsync. Asynchronously retrieve data in manageable chunks, ideal for pagination and optimal performance.
- **Existence Checks (Async)**: Make informed decisions with the lightning-fast ExistsAsync method, which swiftly confirms entity existence. Eliminate unnecessary database calls. ⚡

## Deep Data Insights:

- **Efficient Counting**: Gain a clear picture of your data with CountAsync for total entity counts or leverage LongCountAsync for accurate counts, even with massive datasets.
- **Targeted Counting (Async)**: Delve deeper with CountByAsync. Asynchronously count entities based on specific conditions, empowering you with granular insights into your data distribution.

## Seamless Integration & Optimization:

- **Effortless Entity Framework Core Integration**: Designed for flawless collaboration with Entity Framework Core, allowing you to leverage its full potential.
- **Eager Loading (Optional)**: Boost performance by pre-fetching related entities when retrieving primary data (including an asynchronous EagerLoadAsync option), minimizing subsequent database calls. ️

## This is Just the Beginning:

- **Community-Driven Expansion**: We welcome contributions to broaden support for additional data access providers beyond Entity Framework Core! Let's make this a universally applicable solution!
- **Unwavering Testing Excellence**: Our relentless pursuit of unit testing coverage ensures unmatched reliability. You can trust your data access layer with confidence!
- **Empowering Documentation (Coming Soon)**: Expect even more detailed examples, tutorials, and guides to transform you into a data access master!

**This is the dawn of a new era for data access in .NET. Get ready to experience the power and efficiency of Buzruk.GenericRepository v1.0.0!**
